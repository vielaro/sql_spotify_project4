## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced). The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```
## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 4. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

#### Easy Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
  
#### Advanced Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.

### 5. Query Optimization
In advanced stages, the focus shifts to improving query performance. Some optimization strategies include:
- **Indexing**: Adding indexes on frequently queried columns.
- **Query Execution Plan**: Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to review and refine query performance.

## 13 Practice Questions

### Easy Level
1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
```sql
SELECT 
	artist,
	track,
	stream
FROM spotify
WHERE stream > 1000000000
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```
2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
```sql
SELECT 
	DISTINCT album,
	artist
FROM spotify;
```
3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where `licensed = TRUE`.
```sql
SELECT 
	SUM(comments) AS total_comments
FROM spotify
WHERE licensed = 'true';
```
4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type `single`.
```sql
SELECT 
	track,
	album_type
FROM spotify
WHERE album_type = 'single';
```
5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.
```sql
SELECT 
	artist,
	COUNT(*) AS number_tracks
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1;
```
### Medium Level
1. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
```sql
SELECT
	artist,
	album,
	AVG(danceability) avg_danceability
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```
2. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
```sql
SELECT
	track,
	energy
FROM spotify
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
3. List all tracks along with their views and likes where `official_video = TRUE`.
```sql
SELECT
	track,
	SUM(views) AS total_views,
	SUM(likes) AS total_likes
FROM spotify
WHERE official_video = 'true'
GROUP BY 1;	
```
4. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
```sql
SELECT
	album,
	track,
	SUM(views) AS total_views
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```
5. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.
```sql
SELECT * FROM 
(SELECT
	track,
	COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on = 'Youtube' THEN stream END),0) AS streamed_on_youtube, 
	COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on = 'Spotify' THEN stream END),0) AS streamed_on_spotify
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
) AS t1
WHERE 
	streamed_on_spotify > streamed_on_youtube
	AND streamed_on_youtube <> 0; 
```
### Advanced Level
1. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
```sql
WITH ranking_artist
AS
(SELECT 
	artist,
	track,
	SUM(views) AS total_views,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY artist ORDER BY SUM(views) DESC) AS rank
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 3 DESC
)
SELECT * FROM ranking_artist
WHERE rank <= 3;
```
2. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
```sql
SELECT 
	track,
	liveness
FROM spotify
WHERE liveness >(SELECT AVG(liveness) FROM spotify);
```
3. **Use a `WITH` clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**
```sql
WITH cte
AS
(
SELECT
	album,
	MAX(energy) AS highest_energy,
	MIN(energy) AS lowest_energy
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
	album,
	highest_energy - lowest_energy AS difference
FROM cte
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
